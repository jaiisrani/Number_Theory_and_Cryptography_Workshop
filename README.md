# Introduction To Number Theory And Cryptography Workshop

Welcome aboard! This is the official GitHub Repository for the Introduction to Number Theory and Cryptography Workshop organised by the [Maths and Physics Club](http://mnp-club.github.io/), IIT Bombay. 
The main aim of this workshop will be to introduce some concepts of number theory and cryptography and implement them using Python.

Certificates will be awarded on the basis of the meeting the completion criteria [[1](/Number%20Theory)].

## Starting up

Try to get Jupyter Notebook up and running. The easiest way to install is through a package installer called *conda* and the instructions can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). It is equally easy on Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Later, run the following codes in the *Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)*
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge notebook
jupyter lab
```
This [installation guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) contains more detailed instructions.
You will also require the packages **numpy**, **scipy**, **matplotlib** and **os** but these come included with **Jupyter** anyway.<br>

Also, if you are familiar with these, you might also want to follow proper environment practices.

## About GitHub

If you are familiar with github or have github desktop we recommend cloning the repo to your computer or if you arent familiar with github then you can simply download as zip by clicking at the green **Code** button above and select **Download ZIP**. You will have to of course download it again as we update more notebooks in here.
To download the notebooks individually you have to select **Raw** button and then save as on that page and you will have to choose the save as in *all files* and it would automatically come as Notebook_name.ipynb.txt so you have to save it as just Notebook_name.ipynb by removing the .txt from the extension. In case your computer doesnt allow you to actually change extensions, you can open it in notepad or any text editor and save as in *all files* and keep the .ipynb extension and you will be done.<br>
Alternatively you may also choose to open [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and here select the **Github** tab and enter the link of this repo and it will list all the notebooks in this repo and you can then proceed to download from there however we will strongly recommend you to not use google colab as you may face errors. 

Once you are done with all this you can start with the notebooks :)

## Material for the Workshop

*Day 0*: <br>[Session recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SeQPHmDuDhe_lZz6MRtx5ymNXKn6ADLI/view?usp=drivesdk)
<br>[Slides](Number%20Theory/Slides/Day%200.pdf)

*Day 1*: <br>Session links - [Part 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZZmoPK2yrnuXBdOJUlYcva9MBBxh2qVl/view?usp=drivesdk), [Part 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1umh3L-pebj3T6VHnXRgaSe2qg95FwTKy/view?usp=drivesdk)
<br>[Slides](Number%20Theory/Slides/Day%201.pdf)
<br>[Assignment](Number%20Theory/Assignments/Day%201%20Assignment.ipynb)

The assignment is fill in the blanks type, where you have to fill in the code in a jupyter notebook. If you couldn't get jupyter up and running, you can check out [this link](https://youtu.be/CwFq3YDU6_Y)

Cryptography stuff can be found [here](/Cryptography)

**Note:** the markdown texts may look a little messed up on the github preview but on downloading it will be completely fine.

If you are facing troubles you can ask your doubts on the [Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/numbertheorymnp/shared_invite/zt-k2soxcki-KjB45dA0FehDKvTWN9KBOQ).<br>

We will have a guest lecture by [Shanta Laishram](https://www.isical.ac.in/shanta-laishram), Indian Statistical Institute on 26th December at 7 PM

We hope you have fun and learn something new :)
