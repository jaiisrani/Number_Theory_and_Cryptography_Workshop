# Cryptography

Where to begin? Check out this [Handout for Cryptography](https://github.com/mnp-club/Number_Theory_and_Cryptography_Workshop/blob/main/Cryptography/Handout%20for%20Cryptography.pdf). It will introduce you, the reader, to the origins of ciphers, and the history and progression of cryptography as a field. It is pretty self-contained and goes light on Number Theory. If you haven't already caught up on the previous two days of material on Number Theory, I still recommend reading those up as it will come into play during the live session.

Once you have gone through the handout provided, check out the demo notebook on [Many-Time Pad](Many-Time%20Pad.ipynb), which as you may have guessed, is the opposite of a One-Time Pad. It will guide you through why repeated use of a key paves the way for it to be compromised. Try to work on why or how this works, before you run through the code!
