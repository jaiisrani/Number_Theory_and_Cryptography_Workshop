# Cryptography

Where to begin? Check out this [Handout for Cryptography](https://github.com/mnp-club/Number_Theory_and_Cryptography_Workshop/blob/main/Cryptography/Handout%20for%20Cryptography.pdf). It will introduce you, the reader, to the origins of ciphers, and the history and progression of cryptography as a field. It is pretty self-contained and goes light on Number Theory. If you haven't already caught up on the previous two days of material on Number Theory, I still recommend reading those up as it will come into play during the live session.

Notebooks will be uploaded here soon!
