    "Before using the XOR operation, we are going to convert plaintext messages to *hex strings*. This way, each character is represented by its [*ASCII*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) code - a number from 0 to 255. In the *hexadecimal* system, any such number has two digits. We write these two hexadecimal digits instead of the initial character, like \"6f\" instead of letter \"o\" (o is represented by 111 in ASCII), where 'f' corresponds to hexadecimal number 15. We can also convert back from hex strings to the regular strings. These conversions are needed for demonstration purposes only: to avoid using unreadable/invisible characters in the strings we work with."
